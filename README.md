Mappe innlevering/eksamen i Object orienterte 


How to play the game and rules:
---------------------------------

The controls for the tanks are as follows:
- W - Move Forwards
- S - Move Backwards
- A - Turn Left
- D - Turn Right
- Space - Boost
- E - Shooting bullets
- R to reload the game (in case of bugs)

Pickup items:
- Speed boost: Each boost give 5 seconds. It's possible to stack up to max 30 sec.  Yellow sphere to collect.
- Ammo: Refill your ammo. Green sphere to collect. Get 2 bullets per pickup.

Level 1:
- Simple arena with walls and obstacles. 
- Objevts to collect: Speed boost and Ammo. 
- To unlock level 2, you need to shoot down alle the trees. After that a purpel portal will appear that takes you to level 2.


Level 2:
- More complex arena with same aomunt of walls but diffrent obstacles.
- Objects to collect are the same as in level 1
- To win the game you need to shoot down enemy towers. They shoot back at you every 3 seconds.
- You have 10 HP. If you get hit 10 times, you lose the game.
- If you destroy all towers you win the game!

Good luck and have fun!



Own evaluation:

What is good:
- What I'm most proud of in this project is the shooting mechanic and the reloading of ammo.
- I also like that it's possible to stack the boost.
- That the program even works at all!
- The auto aim on the enemy turrets is also something I'm happy with. Makes it more challenging




What can be improved:
- The tank movement could be smoother and more responsive. Also inmport bullet physics to make it more realistic.
- The level design could be more varied and interesting, with different themes and challenges.
- Adding sound effects and music to enhance the gaming experience.
- Have a better 3D model for the tank. One that actually can have rotations on the belt, so that it would look more realstic.
- More detailed textures and enviroment to make the game more immersive
- Have a diffrent type of look on the enemies turrents.
- Didn't have enough time to fix the barrier collision to work properly.
- Overall I wish that I had planed this more properly from the start, so that I could have had more time to implement more features and polish the game. - That would also help me have a better structerd code
